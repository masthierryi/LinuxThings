Only saving my configs

### About the LockSurface.qml: 
Rename the old file for backup, and use my file. The path:
~/.config/quickshell/ii/modules/ii/lock/LockSurface.qml

Is ready for use for the users of this dotfiles: https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland. The animations and dynamic colors must to be adapted if you use other. 
The monitor where the centralBox appear must to be edited manually (laziness), but it is easy;)
